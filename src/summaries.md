Hi there! 👋🏼 On this site you can find a collection of the summaries and cheat sheets I wrote during my studies 👨🏻‍🎓. This is the template I used for my handwriten <a href="../uploads/CheatSheet-Template.pdf"> Cheat Sheets</a>. You can find the LaTeX and Goodnotes files [here 📁](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/ixlLR1QO9KxcQMW). Since it takes a lot of time (and coffee) to write these summaries / cheat sheets, there is a <a class="buymeacoffee" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/9dqc69qgmyE"> BuyMeACoffe ☕️</a> page to support my work. Any support is highly appreciated!
